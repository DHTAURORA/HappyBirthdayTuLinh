              I wanted to write you something real today. Something that tells you just how much I appreciate having you in my life. 
              It’s kind of wild how things work out - we weren't that close before, but reconnecting with you after all these years has meant more to me than I ever expected. 
              I know life’s not always easy. Work feels heavy, not because of the hours, but because of the unspoken things - the things you’ve told me and the things I can quietly sense even when you don’t say them out loud. 
              You don’t always get the support or peace you deserve, but you still get up and carry yourself with strength and kindness every day. 
              That says a lot about you. And I see it. You might not realize it, but there’s something incredibly strong about choosing to be gentle in a world that often isn’t. 
              About staying kind, even when you’re tired. 
              I admire that. I admire you - not because you’re trying to impress anyone, but because you stay true to yourself even when things aren’t perfect. 
              I hope this year brings you closer to the life you really want - not the one you feel stuck with. 
              I hope you find the courage to chase what feels right and the freedom to let go of what doesn’t. 
              You’ve got people around you who love you, and even though I’m just one of them - I hope you know I’m rooting for you, too. Always. 
              No matter where life takes me, this friendship, this connection - it stays with me. Quietly, maybe. But deeply.
              <br />
              Happy birthday again.
              <br />
              You deserve better days ahead - and I believe they’re coming.
              <br />
              <span style="color:#ee2550;">With all my respect and warmest friendship,</span>
              <br />
              <span style="color:#ee2550;">Thành, Uncle T</span>
